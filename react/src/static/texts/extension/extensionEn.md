#### Hi!

You are currently on the web version of the Metada Chrome Extension. The Extension's goal is to remind you of the ownership challenges in the media, fitting in you habits by simply notfying you about the owners. You can install it right now from the official Chrome and Firefox stores! (see hereunder)

We try to provide as many functionalities of the original project as we can. There may however be layout erros (for now!). 

#### About the Extension

The extension is currently under development. For the first version only the French media are available but with the possibility for users to suggest edits to the graph it should grow fast with the next version.


If you are a developper or web designer and want to get involved (frontend or backend) do get in touch (see "Contact")!


##### Installation

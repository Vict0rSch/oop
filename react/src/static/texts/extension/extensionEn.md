#### Hi!

You are currently on the web version of the OOP Chrome Extension. We try to provide as many functionalities of the original project as we can. There may however be layout erros (for now!). 

#### About the Extension

The extension is currently under development. For the first version only the French media are available but with the possibility for users to suggest edits to the graph it should grow fast with the next version.


If you are a developper or web designer and want to get involved (frontend or backend) do get in touch (see "Contact")!


##### Installation

You can download and install the extension as described here: [bit.ly/oopInstall](https://bit.ly/oopInstall)

For now it is only available as a *Chrome* extension, it will be extended to other browsers at some point. If you know someone with Firefox plugin skills, tell them about us!

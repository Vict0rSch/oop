Maybe.Sometimes.Often.Always ? It depends, really: on the media, the owner, the piece of news, the time or location.Knowing who owns the media we're reading is a valuable information in itself. It's neither a good nor bad thing that the media might be (privately) owned.But we ought to think critically about this and keep in mind the interests of the owners of media.";

const p2 = "This is why we started the Open Ownership Project: to provide citizens with an easy way to access this kind of information.It should be visual.It should be open.It should be thought- through together, as a community.It should therefore be a browser plugin: just a mouse- click away - enabling us to find out whether the information we are reading could be biased.";

const p3 = "Our goal is to build a platform allowing us to crowd-source the information so that it becomes scalable in time (new media, new ownerships) and space (different countries). This  platform is still to be designed and discussed. Our initial idea is to allow people to submit relevant pieces of information including where they came from. Moderators will decide whether or not to update the graph accordingly. Machine Learning techniques will be developed to suggest modifications and assist moderators.";

On the technical side, three worlds will meet: front-end, back-end and machine learning. By gathering a community around this project, we also want people to learn from this interaction. Machine Learning people learning Front or Back-end, Full-stacks learning ML etc.";

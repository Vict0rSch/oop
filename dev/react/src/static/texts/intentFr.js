'**Does it make any difference on the content?** No! Maybe. Sometimes. Often. Always? It depends, really: on the media, the owner, the piece of news, the time or location. Knowing who owns the media we\'re reading is a valuable information in itself. It\'s neither a good nor bad thing that the media might be (privately) owned. But we ought to think critically about this and keep in mind the interests of the owners of media.\n',

'This is why we started the **Open Ownership Project**: to provide citizens with an easy way to access this kind of information. It should be visual. It should be open. It should be thought-through together, as a community. It should therefore be a browser plugin: just a mouse-click away - enabling us to find out whether the information we are reading could be biased. \n',

'**Where does the graph come from?** The information in the graph represent Companies (nodes) and the Ownership relations (edges). For the French Media, most of it originally comes from this*  work by Le Monde Diplomatique. Our goal is to build a platform allowing us to crowd-source the information so that it becomes scalable in time (new media, new ownerships) and space (different countries). The idea is to allow people to submit relevant sourced pieces of information. Moderators will decide whether or not to update the graph accordingly. Machine Learning techniques will be developed to suggest modifications and assist moderators.\n',
